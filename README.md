## Getting Started

### How to run me

You can start by running the following commands in the cloned project folder:

> Depending on the package management tool you use, either **`yarn`** or **`npm`**.
> Start by either running the commands
>
> For yarn, run: ðŸ‘‡
>
> > ```bash
> > yarn
> > ```
>
> For npm, run: ðŸ‘‡
>
> > ```bash
> > npm install
> > ```
>
> Now lets create a env file to hold our environment secrets.
>
> > Still under the project's root folder, run the following command.
> > Inside it add the following:
> >
> > ```bash
> > mkdir config.env
> > ```
> >
> > Done? Now lets open the file in your text editor and paste in the following (Remember to change respective secrets as text coded.):
> >
> > ```env
> > PORT=5000
> > MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/...{the mongo db url, both online or local}
> >
> > JWT_SECRET={your JWT Secret}
> > JWT_EXPIRE=20min

> > EMAIL_SERVICE=SendGrid
> > EMAIL_USERNAME={username as provide by Sendgrid}
> > EMAIL_PASSWORD={password as provided by Sendgrid}
> > EMAIL_FROM={email as provide by sendgrid}

> > The file now has all the required secrets.
>
> Done, and it is time to run it! Again depending with the package manager that you are using.
